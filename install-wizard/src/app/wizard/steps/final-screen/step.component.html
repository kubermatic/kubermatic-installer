    That's it! You have successfully installed Kubermatic and once your certificates are
    acquired you can begin to use it right away using the link below.

  <h2>Helm <code>values.yaml</code></h2>
  <p>
    Make sure to download the <code>values.yaml</code> for Helm in case you want to further
    modify and re-deploy the charts in the future, but since it contains your kubeconfig and
    other credentials, <strong>keep it secret</strong>.

  <h2>Installer Manifest</h2>
  <p>
    We also recommend that you keep a copy of your configuration manifest that you've created
    with this wizard. This allows you to re-run the installer at a later point in time without
    having to re-enter all information again. As with the <code>values.yaml</code>, your manifest
    also contains private information and should be treated carefully.
