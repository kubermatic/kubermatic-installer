    That's it! You have successfully installed Kubermatic and can now begin to use it right away
    to create your own clusters.
  </p>

  <h2>DNS Updates</h2>

  <p>
    You need to update your DNS zone and add new entries for Kubermatic before you can begin
    to use it. Please take a look at the list of records below and update your DNS provider.
  </p>

  <dl class="dns-records">
    <div *ngFor="let record of dnsRecords">
      <dt class="name">{{ record.name }}</dt>
      <dd><span class="type {{ record.type.toLowerCase() }}">{{ record.type }} âžœ</span> <code>{{ record.target }}</code></dd>
    </div>
  </dl>

  <p>
    After the changes have propagated and Kubermatic was able to acquire its TLS certificates,
    you can begin to use it using the link below.

  <h2>Helm <code>values.yaml</code></h2>
  <p>
    Make sure to download the <code>values.yaml</code> for Helm in case you want to further
    modify and re-deploy the charts in the future, but since it contains your kubeconfig and
    other credentials, <strong>keep it secret</strong>.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Installer Manifest</h2>
  <p>
    We also recommend that you keep a copy of your configuration manifest that you've created
    with this wizard. This allows you to re-run the installer at a later point in time without
    having to re-enter all information again. As with the <code>values.yaml</code>, your manifest
    also contains private information and should be treated carefully.
