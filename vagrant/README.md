### Seed cluster test Vagrantfile

The file is used to easily setup a temporary seed cluster for development and experimentation.
Currently supported providers are:
 * VirtualBox
 * Azure

On Azure you must put your app credentials into the following environmental variables:
 * `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
 * `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
 * `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
 * `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

App credentials can be generated by the Azure CLI with the command `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "my-app"`.
